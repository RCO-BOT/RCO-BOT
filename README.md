Ello! I'm Luke, My online name is VAL! - But you can call me what you want so long as you give me coffee.. â˜•

I am the lead developer for the Discord bot [RCO - Roblox Case Opener](https://rco-web.herokuapp.com/) working along side the amazing [SUPERCHIEF](https://github.com/Elara-Discord-Bots)
RCO is my first fully published project. Before releasing RCO I had only ever messed around with JavaScript and watched a few online courses.

I'm currently learning HTML/CSS, Express.JS and EJS.
I'm always looking for pointers in the right direction when it comes to coding.
